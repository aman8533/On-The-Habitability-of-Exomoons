# On The Habitability of Exomoons
The Characterization of habitability in planetary systems is a challenging investigation due to the absence of empirical evidence for extraterrestrial life. We present a framework that models the hab- itability of exomoons in planetary systems in the universe. By analysing the effects of various energy sources on an exomoon such as tidal heating from the host planet, stellar irradiation and the build up of greenhouse gases, we develop a model that is able to combine all of these factors and estimate using physical and orbital parameters of the moon, whether it is habitable or not. We relate the equilibrium temperature along with the energy budget to deduce whether a planet remains in the habitable zone long enough to support life. We model the percentage of energy that is absorbed and emitted back out by the moon over geological time scales. Being able to estimate whether a natural satellite is habitable or not will allow us to rank known bodies with respect to their potential for supporting life. Once exomoons are discovered, we will be able to use this ranking to target satellites like the JWST at these moons to advance our voyage for discovering life outside our Earth.
